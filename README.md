# Tree-Based Models for Classification in Python

Description:
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing the implementation of tree-based models for classification tasks using Python. The notebook covers the use of decision trees and random forests, along with preprocessing techniques and model evaluation.

**Key Features:**

1. **Decision Trees:** The notebook introduces decision trees for classification and demonstrates how to build a decision tree classification model using the Iris dataset. It includes preprocessing steps such as standardization and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training and Testing:** It provides detailed instructions on training the decision tree classifier and evaluating its performance on the test set. Model evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated and presented using the `classification_report` function.

3. **Tuning Parameters:** The notebook discusses techniques for tuning parameters to improve the decision tree model's performance. It explores how adjusting parameters such as the maximum depth of the tree can impact the model's accuracy and generalization ability.

4. **Random Forest Classification:** Additionally, the notebook introduces random forest classification, a powerful ensemble learning technique. It demonstrates how to build and evaluate a random forest classifier using the same Iris dataset, providing insights into its performance compared to the decision tree model.

**Usage:**

Data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and students can utilize this repository to learn about tree-based models for classification and gain practical experience in implementing these algorithms using Python's popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
